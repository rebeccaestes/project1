THE GAME OF WAR

Tips:

- yourDeck and oppoDeck are arrays of each user's cards. You can force a war by setting cards of the same index to be equal in the console (`yourDeck[0] = oppoDeck[0]`)
- Interesting things happen when the joker (or jester; they're equivalent) is played</li>
- Extra interesting things happen when two jokers are played against each other</li>
- There are two ways to end the game: 1. play more than 10 regular rounds, and at least one war; or 2. one player loses all their cards. Different things happen in each case
