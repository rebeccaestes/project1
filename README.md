GA Project 1: War

1. As a player, I want to be able to play War against the computer, so that I can play War when I'm bored and alone.
2. As a player, I want to be able to see how many cards I have and how many my opponent has, so I can see if I'm winning this match.
3. As a player, I want to be able to view the results from each match, so I can see how many matches I've won this session.
4. As a player, I want to be able to record the length of each match, so I can see how much time I'm wasting.
5. As a player, I would like to play matches in groups of five, so that I don't waste more time than necessary playing War.
