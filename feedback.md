# Project Feedback + Evaluation

## Project Workflow

>Did you complete the user stories, wireframes, task tracking, and/or ERDs, as specified above? Did you use source control as expected for the phase of the program youâ€™re in (detailed above)?

**Exceeds Expectations** Great user stories! Great detail. In the future it would be good to add the names of the technologies used (JQuery, CSS, etc) to that section of the readme.

## Technical Requirements

>Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

**Meets Expectations** Looks good. You've successfully combined the technologies and techniques we're covered so far into a fully-functional app with no obvious major bugs.

## Code Quality

>Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code as your instructors have in class?

**Meets Expectations** There's a lot of repetition in your code, as well as some unwieldy conditionals. I would encourage you to try using objects, or at least nested arrays, to store variables and values more meaningfully, as well as replacing id's with classes whenever possible. I see the same groups of id's popping up together in repeated code, which suggests that you could call methods on all of them at once without altering your functionality.

## Problem Solving

>Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

**Meets Expectations** Not much to say, really. A solid project, Rebecca!
